# Storage Browser POC

A Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating an Amazon S3 Storage Browser built with Next.js and AWS Amplify Gen 2. This application integrates the `@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage` component to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing, uploading, and managing S3 objects directly within a web application.

## Key Features
- **S3 Management:** Visualize and interact with Amazon S3 buckets.
- **Modern UI:** Built with `@aws-amplify/ui-react` and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend Infrastructure:** Uses AWS Amplify Gen 2 (CDK-based) for cloud resources.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
